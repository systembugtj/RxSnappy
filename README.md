#RxSnappy

Forked from https://github.com/team-supercharge/rxsnappy

Move to use RxJava2 and SnappyDB with Kryo 4.x

RxSnappy is a thread safe rxjava wrapper for the great [SnappyDB](http://www.snappydb.com/) fast key-value database for Android.

This library offers a time based raw response cache solution on client side.


## Usage
* __Get artifact__

```gradle
compile 'io.supercharge:rxsnappy:0.4.0'
```



* __In application's onCreate() call__

```java
RxSnappy.init(context);
```

* __Create RxSnappyClient__

```java
RxSnappyClient rxSnappyClient = new RxSnappyClient();

rxSnappyClient.setObject(key, object).subscribe(object -> ...);

rxSnappyClient.getObject(key, Object.class).subscribe(object -> ...);

```
* __Every record automatically gets an id which id is the date in milliseconds of the insertion__

```java

public Observable<FooResponse> getFooResponse(String token, BarRequest barRequest){

//Generate unique key 
final String key = RxSnappyUtils.generateKey("fooresponse", token, barRequest);

//Look for in cache with a time interval (ms)
//If the data in cache is older than 15 sec it throws an exception
return rxSnappyClient.getObject(key, 15000L, FooResponse.class)
	.onErrorResumeNext(retrofitApi.getFooResponse(token, barRequest)
		.flatMap(fooResponse -> rxSnappyClient.setObject(key, fooResponse));
}

```
